# 🚀 Fixed Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The issue was that the file-based storage (`data/gallery.json`) doesn't work on Vercel's serverless environment. 

**Solution:** Now using Uploadthing's API to directly fetch and manage files from their cloud storage.

---

## 📋 Vercel Environment Variables

Add these **3** environment variables to Vercel:

1. **UPLOADTHING_SECRET**
   - Value: `[Your Uploadthing Secret Key]`

2. **UPLOADTHING_APP_ID**
   - Value: `dj_rishi`

3. **UPLOADTHING_TOKEN** (NEW - Required!)
   - Value: `[Same as UPLOADTHING_SECRET]`

> **Note:** Get your secret key from [Uploadthing Dashboard](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)

### How to Add in Vercel:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click your **dj_rishi** project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add each variable:
   - Click "Add New"
   - Enter Name and Value
   - Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"
5. Repeat for all 3 variables

## 📤 Deploy the Fix

Run these commands:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Use Uploadthing API for gallery storage (Vercel compatible)"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy in ~2 minutes.

## ✅ How It Works Now

### Upload Flow:
1. User uploads image in `/admin`
2. Image goes directly to Uploadthing cloud
3. Metadata (title, category) stored with the upload
4. Gallery fetches images from Uploadthing API
5. **No file system needed** - works perfectly on Vercel!

### Fetch Flow:
1. Gallery page calls `/api/gallery`
2. API fetches all files from Uploadthing
3. Returns list with URLs, titles, categories
4. Gallery displays images

### Delete Flow:
1. User clicks delete in admin panel
2. API calls Uploadthing to delete file
3. File removed from cloud storage
4. Gallery auto-refreshes

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

1. Visit: `https://djrishi.vercel.app/admin`
2. Login with password: `djrishi2024`
3. Upload a test image
4. Check `/gallery` - image should appear!
5. Delete test image from admin
6. Refresh gallery - should be gone!

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Broken on Vercel):
- ❌ Stored data in `data/gallery.json` file
- ❌ File system writes don't persist on Vercel
- ❌ Images uploaded but not shown

### After (Works on Vercel):
- ✅ Uses Uploadthing's API to list files
- ✅ No file system needed
- ✅ Images upload AND display correctly
- ✅ Delete works perfectly

## 💡 Benefits

- **No Database Needed** - Uploadthing handles everything
- **Free Tier** - 2GB storage, 500MB/month bandwidth
- **Persistent** - Images never disappear
- **Fast** - CDN-delivered images
- **Simple** - One API manages everything

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Images still not showing after deploy?**
1. Check all 3 env variables are in Vercel
2. Verify they're in "Production" environment
3. Trigger a new deployment
4. Clear browser cache

**Upload fails?**
1. Check Uploadthing dashboard for errors
2. Verify API keys are correct
3. Check browser console for errors

**Old images from local dev?**
Those were only in local `data/gallery.json` - upload them again through `/admin` to save to cloud!
